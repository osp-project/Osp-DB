# OSP-DB
### A simple database based on Json files, so easy that even your neighborâ€™s 8-year-old kid can understand it.

## Usage
There is no specific usage instruction at the moment, because there are so many ways to use it. Since OSP-DB is developed for other projects of osp-project, you may find some references from the code of other projects of osp-project?

## Test
Clone this repository, open Osp-DB.sln with Visual Studio, then change the Output type of this project to Console Application, and uncomment the Main function in Program.cs, then compile and start the program. 

Warning: If you plan to submit a PR, please change the Output type back to Class Library before submitting the PR.
